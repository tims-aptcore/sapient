# How to contribute

We would like to see this software used in as many SAPIENT compatible products as possible. This will improve the quality of the software for all of us.

You can help in one of these ways:
  * Use the software in your product and report (or fix) any bugs you find
  * Add support for missing features described in the Interface Control Document
  * Add support for your platform and hardware (if they are open source)

## Submitting changes

You will need to request an invite before you can push your changes.

Please commit one bug fix or feature addition at a time with a clear commit message, including any testing that has been done.

## Coding conventions

When editing an existing file please use the same coding style. Don't be offended if your edits get auto formatted at a later date.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. There are no bonus points for doing everything in one line!
